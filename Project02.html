This is a LEMP stack implementation Project 

Connected to my Mac terminal via Ubuntu

Inorder to display web pages to our site visitors, Nginx will have to be installed

To install nginx - sudo aot update 

sudo apt install nginx

sudo systemctl status nginx - to verify that nginx was successfully installed

The server is now running and can be accessed locally from the internet

to try to check how to access from ubuntu, run: curl http://localhost:80

Now that there is a webserver running, we need to install  database Management System 

To install DBMS, MySQL will be used for this project. to install mysql server run the below command
    
sudo apt install mysql-server    

After the installation, log into MySql with the below command

sudo mysql    

This will connect to the MySQL server as the administrative database userrRoot

it is recommended to run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL

You will need a password for the root user before running the script. 

run: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';

to test the password and to be sure you are able to log in run the below command

sudo mysql -p

Apache embeds the PHP interpreter in each request. php-fpm will need to be installed. This will communicate with MySql-based databeses.

to install the packages, run:

sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql

On ubuntu 20.04, nginx has one server block enabled and is configure to serve documents out of a directory at /var/www/html.

to create the root web directory for your_domain

run: sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP

there is need to assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable. to do that run:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

This will create a new blank file. paste the folowing configuration

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}

Activate the configuration by linking to the config file from nginx's sites-enabled. run:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

to test the configuration for syntax error run:

sudo nginx -t

to also disable default nginx currently configured  to listen on port 80, run 

sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

the new website is now active but the web root /var/www/projectlemp is still empty. to test that our new server block works, create an index.html file in that location

run: sudo echo 'Hello LEMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectLEMP/index.html

this is what you see when you open on a browser

The LAMP stack is now completely installed and fully operational.

to test and to validate that nginx can correctly hand .php files off to our new PHP processor, create a test PHP  file in your document root. 

open a new file called info.php within your document root in your text editor, run:

sudo nano /var/www/projectLEMP/info.php

type the following lines into the new file : <?php
phpinfo();

the page can now be accessed in your web browser by visiting the domain name;

http://`server_domain_or_IP`/info.php

connect to MySql console to create a test database with simple 'to do list' and configure access to it

run: sudo mysql

to create a new database, run:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE `example_database`;

the command below creates a new user name by using myswl_native_password as default authentication method

mysql>  CREATE USER 'example_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';

to test if the new user has the proper permission, run: 

mysql -u example_user -p

after loging into MySQL, confirm that you have access to the example_database by running the below command: 

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
