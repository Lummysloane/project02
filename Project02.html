Now that there is a webserver running, we need to install  database Management System 

To install DBMS, MySQL will be used for this project. to install mysql server run the below command
    
sudo apt install mysql-server    

After the installation, log into MySql with the below command

sudo mysql    

This will connect to the MySQL server as the administrative database userrRoot

it is recommended to run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL

You will need a password for the root user before running the script. 

run: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';

to test the password and to be sure you are able to log in run the below command

sudo mysql -p

Apache embeds the PHP interpreter in each request. php-fpm will need to be installed. This will communicate with MySql-based databeses.

to install the packages, run:

sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql

On ubuntu 20.04, nginx has one server block enabled and is configure to serve documents out of a directory at /var/www/html.

to create the root web directory for your_domain

run: sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP

there is need to assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable. to do that run:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

This will create a new blank file. paste the folowing configuration

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}

Activate the configuration by linking to the config file from nginx's sites-enabled. run:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

to test the configuration for syntax error run:

sudo nginx -t

to also disable default nginx currently configured  to listen on port 80, run 

sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
